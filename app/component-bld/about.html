            <h4>Producer &amp; Co-host</h4>
            <p>When Alicia isn’t Art Directing at <a href="http://www.meetneighbor.com/">NEIGHBOR</a> (an animation studio she co-founded in Minneapolis), she can often be found wearing fuzzy hats dreaming of tiny houses in Hawaii. Her passion for animation extends from educational content such as her work for TED-Ed “When Molecules Collide”, to experimental media as seen in her live action/2D animation “Western Civilization.”</p>

            <p>Julia is a design, illustration, and animation triple threat whose tenacity shows in her recent promotion to Lead Production Designer at <a href="http://www.meetneighbor.com/">NEIGHBOR</a>.

Her skills can be seen in such works as TED-Ed’s “Why Should We Eat Bugs”, which had over a million hits and can now be viewed on Netflix. Her creativity floods into her daily life where she surrounds herself with bright colors, antiques, and an assortment of thrifted treasures.  </p>

She consults as a front-end web developer, and is the web director at <a href="http://gitmsp.org">GiTMSP</a> (a social network with the purpose to empower women in tech), pretty rad right? She balances her love for technology with a love for the environment, because yes the two actually CAN co-exist. Intertwined with her love for sustainability and the earth is her interest in biomimicry, and her hobbies of backpacking, camping, and fishing.</p>
